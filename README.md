# Not My President
A simple open-source sign for protest, if you want one. Designed specifically for making into a stencil, with no "islands" of white space that are unattached from the outside and all straight edges to make it easy to cut out. Obviously, though, you don't have to get fancy, and it will work fine in any form.

Carry an American flag _and_ an American sentiment, in one convenient package!

Just download the zip, then choose what color works best for your needs over the weekend / next four years.
